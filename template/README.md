The mod adds dragging support to use/sell/buy cards like on the mobile version of the game. Works great on Steam Deck using the touch display.

The mod implements a hybrid mix between the desktop and mobile UI. You can both click on a card and click on the action button like normal, or you can drag the cards to the actions area that shows up when a card is being dragged on the mobile version of the game.

The mod also add the ability to select card in your hand by dragging across them. You can also deselect card this way. The state (selected or not selected) of the first card touched decide what happen to all the card you touch.

Some options are available in the game settings:
 - Enable Actions Buttons.
 - Enable drag to select/deselect from hand area.
 - Drag Area Opacity (Default: 90%).
 - Move Joker Booster Pack Select Area To Joker Buy Area.

On the mobile version of the game when you buy a joker you drag it to the top of the screen over the joker and consumable area. But when opening a Joker booster pack you have to drag the Joker to the middle of the screen to select it.

If you ever found yourself trying to drag the card to your joker section this option is for you.
